# We have used codes from Chandrashekar et al. (2021) replication study
# Our data set is in brazilian portuguese, so we'll provide here a description for each variable
# Also, we provide a comparison between our variable names and the ones used by Chandrashekar et al. (2021)

#### On the left, the variables used by Chandrashekar et al. (2021)
#### On the right, the equivalent variables used in our data set and our codes
#### There are two variables for: 8 biases, 3 personal shortcomings and two means. Each one is measured for "self" and "other"
#### HKUS stands for "Hong Kong University" (sample used for Chandrashekar et al. (2021) study)

# 1. Self_SSS, HKUS_SSS   =   self_ego, other_ego
# 2. Self_SIB, HKUS_SIB   =   self_IP , other_IP
# 3. Self_RD, HKUS_RD     =   self_DRP, other_DRP
# 4. Self_FAE, HKUS_FAE   =   self_AEC, other_AEC  
# 5. Self_HME, HKUS_HME   =   self_midia, other_midia
# 6. Self_PHE, HKUS_PHE   =   self_halo, other_halo
# 7. Self_AS, HKUS_AS     =   self_desc, other_desc
# 8. Self_DR, HKUS_DR     =   self_rac, other_rac
# A. Self_Proc, HKUS_Proc =   SELF_proc, OTHER_proc
# B. Self_FPS, HKUS_FPS   =   SELF_RF, OTHER_RF
# C. Self_PF, HKUS_PF     =   SELF_PO, OTHER_PO
# M1. BS_Mean, BO_Mean    =   BS_Mean, BO_Mean
# M2. PSS_Mean, PSO_Mean  =   PSS_Mean, PSO_Mean

#### On the left, variable names (we opted to use the same names provided in the code)
#### On the right, definitions (Pronin et al., 2002)

# 1. selfserv             =   self-serving attributions for success versus failure (translated as "egocentric" in the portuguese survey) 
# 2. selfint              =   judgments about the “greater good” influenced by personal self-interest  
# 3. reactideval          =   reactive devaluation of proposals from one’s negotiation counterparts
# 4. FAE                  =   the fundamental attribution error (FAE) in “blaming the victim”
# 5. hostmed              =   perceptions of hostile media bias toward one’s group or cause
# 6. Halo                 =   the positive halo effect
# 7. biassim              =   biased assimilation of new information
# 8. cogdis               =   dissonance reduction after free choice
# A. procrast             =   procrastination
# B. FPS                  =   fear of public speaking
# C. Planfall             =   planning fallacy
# M1. avg.bias8           =   mean of 8 biaes
# M2. avg.pershort        =   mean personal shortcomings
